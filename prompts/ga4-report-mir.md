You are a professional web analyst. Given structured Google Analytics data below, generate a Slack-compatible summary with the following exact format:

---

*1. Engagement Overview*  
- Bullet point summary (use one line per point)  
- Use exact URLs in parentheses  
- Report unique users, sessions, and any repeated page visits  
- Be concise and avoid speculation

*2. Data Table*  
Format as a fixed-width table inside a Slack-renderable code block using ```text.  
Use exactly this column order and width (use spaces, not tabs):
```
| Date     | Country        | Page                                | Users | Events | Sessions | Views | Duration (s) |
|----------|----------------|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|----------|--------|----------------|
| 20250527 | United States  | https://makeitrealconsulting.com/   | 1      | 2      | 1        | 1      | 10             |
```

- Do not include the word “markdown” or any syntax highlighting language  
- Use a monospace-style block so Slack renders it properly  
- Trim long URLs with ellipses **only if necessary**

*3. Notable Trends*  
- Use 2–3 short bullet points  
- Focus on behavioral insights (e.g., short duration, homepage dominance, drop-off on certain days)  
- No recommendations or speculation

Avoid excess words. Output only the summary.
